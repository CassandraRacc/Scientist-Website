                Born and raised in a small town near Atlanta, Georgia, Tiera Fletcher (Guinn)
                has had a passion for aerospace engineering since the tender age of eleven. 
                Before then, she had aspirations of being a scientist, inventor, architect, 
                mathematician, and many other careers within the field of STEM. It was not 
                until she became introduced to the field of aerospace engineering that she
                realized her true dream. Tiera graduated from the Massachusetts Institute 
                of Technology (MIT) with a Bachelor’s of Science in Aerospace Engineering 
                in June 2017. During her time at MIT, she was also a part-time Rocket 
                Structural Design and Analysis Engineer at The Boeing Company, specifically 
                working on NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS). In support of the SLS program, 
                Tiera has been a Rocket Structural Analysis Engineer, Rocket Structural Engineer
                and Configuration Management and Product Integration Engineer. Currently, Tiera
                remains a full-time employee of The Boeing Company in Maui, Hawaii.
